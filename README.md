# PyScanX

PyScanX is a vulnerability assessment tool that leverages nmap, sslscan, and nikto to perform security scans on provided hosts. It helps identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues in the target systems.

## Prerequisites

Before using PyScanX, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3
- nmap
- sslscan
- nikto

If you have `pip` installed, you can use the following command to install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/UbaidAhmed2803/PyScanX

1. Clone the PyScanX repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyScanX.git
```

2. Change into the PyScanX directory:

```shell
cd PyScanX
```

3. Run the pyscanx.py script and provide the hosts you want to scan:

```shell
python pyscanx.py <host1> <host2> ...
````

Replace <host1>, <host2>, and so on with the actual hosts you want to scan.

4. The tool will initiate the vulnerability assessment using nmap, sslscan, and nikto. The results will be displayed on the console.
